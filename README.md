Hello, my name is **Dr. Birko-Katarina Ruzicka**.

I am a planetary geoscientist who uses remote sensing techniques to study comets, moons, and terrestrial planets.

After graduating with a PhD, I expanded my practical skills as a certified Data Scientist. I now have extensive training and a growing experience in machine learning, neural networks, big data management, databases and SQL, and added fluency in Python and R to my toolbox.

I am fiercely passionate about open and accessible science and knowledge transfer, and excited about translating research into practical applications that solve everyday problems. To that end, I have worked with many projects in the field of scientific outreach, sci com, open data, and open research.
